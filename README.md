## Unlock the Power of Data: Master Filter-Based Feature Selection Techniques ðŸš€

In the dynamic world of data science, extracting actionable insights from complex datasets is paramount. Filter-based feature selection stands as a pivotal step in this journey, enabling us to distill complexity, enhance model performance, and unlock the full potential of our predictive models.

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to mastering filter-based feature selection techniques. Dive into curated resources, Python scripts, and Jupyter notebooks to accelerate your understanding and implementation of these powerful methods.

## Key Features
- **Duplicate Features Removal**: Streamline your dataset by eliminating redundancy and focusing on unique and informative attributes.
- **Variance Threshold Method**: Identify features with meaningful variability, enhancing predictive power and model interpretability.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Address multicollinearity by removing highly correlated features, and refining model performance.
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: Select features significantly impacting the target variable, optimizing model accuracy and predictive power.
- **Chi-Squared Test**: Assess the association between categorical features and the target variable, refining feature selection for precision.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the curated resources, Python scripts, and Jupyter notebooks.
3. Implement filter-based feature selection techniques in your data science projects.
4. Share your insights and experiences with the community.

## Results
Before feature selection, our model achieved an accuracy of **0.8631**. 
After feature selection, we streamlined the feature set to just **101** variables, witnessing a remarkable accuracy boost to **0.9045**.
